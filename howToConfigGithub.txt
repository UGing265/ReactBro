hey 
i want to share you how to deploy github website


go vite.config.js -> add folder Name github like
  base: "/ReactBro",

Go Package.json -> add homepage like this
  "homepage": "https://uging265.github.io/ReactBro/",
  "name": "my-react-app",

in Package.json -> add 2 this (alr test in vite react)
    "predeploy": "npm run build",
    "deploy": "gh-pages -d dist"

    file: dist you have to check in folder if you see file dlist then change gh-pages -d dlist

done go cmd.exe 
run: npm run deploy 

well done you will see 2 branch main and gh-pages lets run web in gh-pages (dont deploy web in main it isn't work)
